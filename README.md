# Encryption_Decryption_Program
A This program encrypts and decrypts similarly as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm.\n
This program either output ciphertext after converting plaintext or vise versa depending upon the option you choose. \n
The program uses getbit(), setbit() and clearbit() operations to manipulate the bits after converting each letter, number or symbol to cipher and vise versa.\n


From plaintext to ciphertext:\n
